# Simple Terminal Game

This repository contains a lightweight Snake game implemented as a Bash script.
It works in any POSIX-compatible terminal.

## Play

Run the script and use the arrow keys to control the snake. Collect `*` to grow
longer and avoid hitting the walls or yourself. Press `q` to quit.

```bash
./game.sh
```
